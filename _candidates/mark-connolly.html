- "Mark believes that the Australian political system needs improving.\tHe does not
  believe that Australians are best represented when they are forced to pick one party
  which then goes on to make significant changes to the Australian life without consultation."

  and overseas, Mark believes he is person to connect, empathize and identify with
  all Australians.  Mark has worked on control and data systems to increase effectiveness
  and efficiency of equipment and processes. He believes Australia and humanity as
  a whole have changed, and that our political system should change to represent this
  fact.
