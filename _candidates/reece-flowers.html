bio:
- Reece is representing the flux party because he believes that if the public are
  given the right tools they will be able to lead with more integrity and flexibility
  than any one party. He believes that Flux has the ability to address some of the
  key issues our democracy is facing. He believes that government should be transparent,
  accountable and above all free from corruption. He is passionate about renewable
  energy and sustainability in general. It is this passion that has led him to engage
  in work for various charities and eventually start his own solar and electrical
  business.
- Reece is excited to see how the Flux system will empower people to make their voices
  heard on the issues we face as a country and as a planet.
