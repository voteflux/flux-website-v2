bio:
- Noven believes passionately in evidence based policy and making politicians accountable
  to their electorate. As an outback    geek he has travelled extensively across Australia
  and is rooted deeply in the regional and remote lifestyle. With a background in
  IT and business he is now learning to build robots and other custom technology.
- His work has taken him all across Australia, and into SE Asia and the Pacific. Living
  and working amongst a diverse range of cultures and environments has given him immense
  insight into the different needs, wants and priorities of various groups. He understands
  that effective government needs to follow a more nuanced and participatory model
  when applied across a diverse populace - a model unattainable with our current system.
