bio:
  - Steven is a unique and personable first generation Australian who believes in honesty, integrity and transparency. He stands firmly against all forms of corruption and is one of the many reasons he decided to get involved in politics. Steven stood as an Independent in the 2015 NSW State election and was notable for his rejection of all 'preference deals' to maintain his independence.
  - During the week, Steven works as an IT Administrator and Team Leader in Sydney to which he travels to from his home in Sydney's west by train. Steven spends his free time volunteering as an animal rescuer and more recently, as a firefighter. He is thrilled to be a part of a team that seeks to return power to where it belongs; the people.
