bio:
- Jeff is a small business owner who’s been self-employed for the last 20 years, providing
  jobs for others, and providing a service to his local community in Adelaide. He’s
  an outside the box thinker, which is one of the reasons he’s so drawn toward Flux,
  as a concept and as a party.
- Through his business, Jeff connects with hundreds of people a day, many of whom
  express continuing frustration with Australia’s political landscape. He sees Flux
  as providing a vehicle for systemic change, and offering solutions to a variety
  of the challenges now facing our country. Jeff has never felt truly aligned with
  one of the major parties, and is excited about a political future that allows us
  to re-engage with a system that affects us all every day, not every 3 years.
