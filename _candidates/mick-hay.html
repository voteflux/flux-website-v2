bio:
- Mick has lived in and worked in Canberra for the past 39 years in the areas of social
  work and electronic communications. While being immersed in Australia's political
  capital he has grown disillusioned with the state of politics in our country. The
  policy backflips the broken promises and the appearance of being In the pockets
  of big business has left in thinking there has to be a better way. Flux gives the
  power back to the people. The system ensures that all voters in Australia have a
  say, not just at election time but throughout the term of the government. He is
  enthusiastic to be a part of this new and exciting evolution in the process of political
  decision making in our wonderful country.
