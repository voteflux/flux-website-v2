bio:
- Stuart believes that a healthy society is one that requires transparent balanced
  discussion of ideas regardless of which side of politics those ideas came from.
  He is ready to see ideas at the forefront of government leadership and not stalemate
  politics where good ideas are quashed out of public view because they go against
  party lines. Stuart understands that a true democracy is one that cannot be influenced
  by third party funding or biased lobbyists with a return of influence to all of
  us that make up the society.
- Stuart's work background is in counter fraud and fraud investigations, more recently
  applying his fraud experience to cognitive computing and analytics in detecting
  fraud. Stuart has over a decade's experience in eDiscovery for litigation and criminal
  matters and computer forensics.
