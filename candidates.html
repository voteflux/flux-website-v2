Flux Senators respect Flux as a method for decision making more than they respect their own opinions. If elected, this may mean casting a vote in the Senate contrary to their personal beliefs.</p>
        <p class="h4 light sm-h3 letter-spacing-3 silver">All our Flux candidates have made a public declaration stating that they will act as a proxy for the Flux system and that they won't use their status for personal gain (including personal policy agenda).</p>
