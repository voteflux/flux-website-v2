bio: 
- >
    I'm Ben, I'm a university student studying Politics and International Relations and frankly, a massive politics nerd.
    At 30 years old, I've been let down enough by the political system and the so-called "representation" we're offered.
    So I committed to studying how it all works, both now and in the last.

    With Flux, I get a chance to be part of fixing it in the future. I don't want to wow you with my intellect or stand
    up as some charismatic leader for everyone to fall in behind. I just want the people I aim to represent to trust
    that I will do as they want, as displayed by the Flux app, and vote how they tell me to vote in Parliament.
    There's not much more to it.
