    bionanotechnology, and space-related fields. He frequently comments on all TV stations, taking on the role
    of a science communicator.

    He is most well known for having an Opal (transport) card implanted into his hand. This resulted in a
    lengthy court case in which has was given a section 10 on two charges, meaning that even though he agreed
    that he broke the rules, that no conviction would be recorded. This case raised many questions for
    the general public relating to bodily sovereignty, ownership of implantable technology, and civil
    liberties in general.
