bio: 
- Mark is a Clinical Laser and Massage Therapist.  He enjoys working in an environment that provides healing light and wellbeing for his clients and finds work very fulfilling.
- Until the Flux Party launched, Mark had no inclination to contribute to a political system that he feels is self-serving and out of touch.  With Flux he sees the potential to bring democracy back into the hands of the people ensuring our government is meeting the needs of all West Australians.
- Outside of business Mark is driven to better understand how humanity has arrived at the place that we are and what he can do within himself to help lead to a better way forward.
