bio:
- Having been born and raised here in West Australia and with a diverse career spanning multiple industries this has afforded me a unique insight and ability to meet people from all over the country from diverse socio economic backgrounds. One thing I have learnt is that fundamentally most people all want the same things from politicians, for them to actually look after the people rather than the perception the general public has of our current Representative Based system.
- Personally having worked for oil companies through to membership associations and national roles in software firms in Sales and Management, to finally becoming self-employed and actually being an employer of others in various capacities, I truly understand the pressures on the average Australian and feel this leads to my current compassion for others and to actually put my hand up to try for change and a better way of doing things.
- Being part of Flux.org allows me the opportunity to put into practice everything I have learnt and I believe the concept of Issue Based Direct Democracy will allow the people a credible alternative to the current political environment. Who would have thought an elected member of the government who will actually do as the public mandates through our technology based platform.
- 43 Years Old
- Lived in the East Metro Region for over 20 years
- Small Business Owner for 15 Years in IT and also previously in Retail/Hospitality, Personal Services & Property Development.
- Member of the Agribusiness Council of Australia.
