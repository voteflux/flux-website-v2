bio: 
- Peter is passionate about people and the environment; Creating a world where no one needlessly endures hardship and the long term survival of the ecosystem are both put paramount to all other endeavors. 
- Peter was born and raised on a farm in the Wheatbelt; He's a software developer, entrepreneur, musician and  father of 1 ,soon to be 2 children. Being a country boy he knows that the heart of the agricultural region is in every small town and every person that lives in them has a right to have their opinion heard; they are all, everyone of them integral to making a community function.
- He believes the Flux system is an optimal solution for getting people involved with politics on their terms, re-engaging the disenfranchised and ultimately will make the world a better place for people.
