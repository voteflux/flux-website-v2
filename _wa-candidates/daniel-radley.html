- Though young at 32 years of age Daniel has seen many have become disillusioned with the current batch of politicians whom seem to be more interested with serving themselves than the people they were chosen to represent. He believes the Flux system will give the people true democracy and allow their voices to be heard and listened to once again in parliament.
