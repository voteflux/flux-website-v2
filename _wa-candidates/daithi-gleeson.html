bio:
- Daithi is passionate about making WA a global leader in good governance. He moved to WA from Galway, Ireland in 2010 and has since made Perth his home. He works as a business consultant advising mining & technology companies on strategy, planning and hands-on implementation.
- He holds a B.Sc. in Mathematical Science and M.Sc. in Communication Systems.
- As a communication specialist, having worked across various industries (government, education, telecommunications & mining) and 5 continents, he recognises that engaging people on the issues in Parliament is the best way to create legislation which works for regular people, and not just powerful lobby groups.
- "Communication which transcends idealogy is the key to unlocking the difficult political issues in our society. By voting for Flux, I believe that all people will have a legitimate voice in governing our beautiful state."
