bio: 
- I am a Politics & International Relations student, well aware of the failings of modern representative government but attempting to inform myself well enough that I could help find a better way. A better way to actually represent the people and engage them in the political process.
- The internet was meant to bring that in, the free flow of knowledge and instantaneous communication was meant to shine the light on all the failings of our system and we'd fix them up... but it never happened.
- Until I found out about the Flux movement and realised the true power of all our technological and communicative advancements. Not to long ago I was amongst political students, now I find myself amongst political visionaries.
- It's good to be here.
