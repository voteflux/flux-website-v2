bio: 
- Kai is a 35 year old who is passionate and positive about the region and community.  Kai has a connection with the mining, pastoral and fishing industries across the Mining and Pastoral Region electorate. Kai was born in Carnarvon in the North West, raised and lived in the Kimberley and Pilbara (where he has spent most of his adult life).  Kai has lived and worked in many locations throughout the mining and pastoral region including several Pilbara towns and Aboriginal remote communities, along with time spent working in Broome and Kalgoorlie in the Goldfields. Kaiâ€™s immediate and extended family lives throughout the region.
- As a youth Kai was awarded the Young Person of the Year (Port Hedland) in 2000 leading to being delegate for the National Youth Roundtable, and member of WA Community Drug Summit in 2001. 
- While Kai has a mechanical engineering trade (gained in the Pilbara), his work history is varied including managing a youth service, providing water services to remote Aboriginal communities, working in the prawning and pearling industry, supporting high school education and retention and providing carer support to the elderly.  After working with the Australia Bureau of Statistics on the Census (Pilbara District Manager) in 2016, Kai is currently working as a self-employed fitter and rural property services.
- Advocating for elders in the community, being a youth support mentor and studying sociology and anthropology are areas of passion.  Kai also has a keen interest in collecting and restoring historical items, exploring and fossicking for precious stones and minerals in remote areas, and being part of positive outcome wherever he is.
- Through the Flux system of democracy Kai wants to be YOUR representative in the Mining and Pastoral Region (for the Legislative Council), to be accessible to YOU at all times, and to be YOUR voice with integrity.
