bio: 
- I am super motivated to see a real change in politics. I have loved living in my home town of Geraldton, Western Australia. I have been a part of traditional politics for some time – while at high  school I launched a social media campaign to save a historic roundabout even convening a special meeting of council at fourteen years old.
- It didn’t work ! but I made a lot of friends and have been involved in local politics ever since, campaigning for local representatives and becoming friends with local and state politicians– then campaigning for my self as councillor for my home constituency.
- I have been proud to be working as hard as I can for the local community ever since, and while I have helped to make lots of positive changes I can see a better way.
- Flux and I, a better system – a real change
