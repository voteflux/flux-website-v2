bio: 
- Ryan has lived, worked and travelled throughout South East Asia, and speaks fluent Indonesian.
- Ryan is now studying to become an Indonesian teacher at High School because he believes that better understanding one another can bring Australia and its closest neighbour closer together. And so it is too with Flux.
- Ryan believes that Flux will take the hate and the anger out of politics and give us the tools to better understand one another and find compromise on the most difficult political issues.
