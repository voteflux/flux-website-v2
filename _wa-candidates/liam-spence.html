bio: 
- Liam is a passionate student of politics and history and an advocate for changes in the current political system. A British expat who has lived in Australia for most of his life, he's looking to make an impact upon the current system.
- Joining with Flux in early 2017, he hopes to see a potential future where the issues of corruption within politics can be removed entirely. Having strongly supported the ideals of Direct Democracy before discovering Flux, he's in it for the long run.
