bio: 
- Anthony is computer technician by trade and believes Flux has the potential to improve people’s lives and make their voices heard on any and all government projects. Working in a small business in midland and helping out on various community projects like the Mundi Biddy track.
- He understands that the current system is broken and needs to be changed hopefully for the better, politicians hold no responsibility on promises they make and rarely if ever ask the peoples opinions.
- He is looking forward to a new system where everyone can have an equal say (if they choose to use it). Furthermore, when other parts of the world will look towards Western Australia as the future of truly democratic society.
