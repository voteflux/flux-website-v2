bio: 
- Owen wants to live in community that is constantly changing for the better. He believes that the best change can happen from educating and empowering the people in that community. That’s what drew him to Flux. His educational background is in engineering and science and he has had a lifelong interest in sports, tech and the arts. 
- Following his passion for the Perth cultural scene during his studies, he worked many jobs in the exploding bar and event scene around Perth. Then in pursuit of his engineering endeavours he took up employment in the mining sector and explored the many facets of the resources industry from the Pilbara mine sites to the Perth offices and operation centres. He then returned to university to undertake his Master’s Degree in Professional Engineering. During that time he found a passion for teaching and inspiring the community through his work with the state science centre, performing to over 20,000 visitors per year.
- Owen believes that change comes from education, and that inspiring people to self-educate and read widely can become a powerful catalyst for a better future. His first political activism was an experiment with the ABC’s VoteCompass, to enlighten people on policy-based voting and how that often did not align with their chosen Political Party.  Owen is an avid supporter of direct democracy and the upgrading of the outdated representative democratic system.
