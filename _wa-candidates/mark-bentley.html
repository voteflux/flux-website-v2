bio: 
- Mark Bentley is a single father of a beautiful 7 year old son, and home educator. It is for his sons future that Mark has committed to the Flux Vision in returning the power to where it belongs, in the hands of the people. 
- The time for politics as we know it has come to an end, and it is now time to upgrade the very system of democracy itself so that it once again represents a government for the people, by the people. 
- Mark is a strong advocate for not getting obsessed with the surface issues but at correcting the very social/political environments that create them, and through Flux he feels this is truly an incredible opportunity to finally enact some real change!
