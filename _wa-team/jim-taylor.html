bio:
  - Stuart believes that a healthy society is one that requires transparent balanced discussion of ideas regardless of which side of politics those ideas came from. He is ready to see ideas at the forefront of government leadership and not stalemate politics where good ideas are quashed out of public view because they go against party lines. Stuart understands that a true democracy is one that cannot be influenced by third party funding or biased lobbyists with a return of influence to all of us that make up the society.
  - Stuart's work background is in counter fraud and fraud investigations, more recently applying his fraud experience to cognitive computing and analytics in detecting fraud. Stuart has over a decade's experience in eDiscovery for litigation and criminal matters and computer forensics.
