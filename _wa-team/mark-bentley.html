bio:
  - Ric is passionate about human rights and seeks to contribute to a fair and rational society, founded on a better Australian democracy. He is committed to serving his local, national and global community. He holds qualifications in science, paramedicine and a Masters Degree in Public Health.
  - Having served his community as a paramedic for over 20 years, Ric now works as an academic and educator.  He believes the current disconnect between Australian voters and the political process needs innovative thinking, new systems that reward integrity and that ensure dynamic accountability. The Flux Party represents to Ric the ideal platform to achieve a new order of democracy, better suited to the needs of contemporary Australia in a changing world. He holds that whilst our political system has served us well throughout history, it is time for the Australian people to be heard and justly represented.
