_**Link to application form is found below. Please read this document before submitting your application.**_

In the absence of the Flux Queensland’s formal leadership (comprised of the Leader and Deputy Leader of the federal Flux Party), the Party’s ordinary governance and decision making will be conducted by a Steering Committee of 5 initial party members. 
 
Applicants for the Steering Committee should be prepared to form the Party’s organisation backbone and as such, have as strong commitment to the Party’s objectives, philosophy and vision. 

Initial Steering Committee members are expected to play a vital role in Flux Queensland's establishment over the next few months. During the election campaign, it is expected that Steering Committee members are available for weekly meetings, and are prepared to contribute up to 20 hours per week toward campaign goals . 

The roles required to form the Steering Committee are as follows: 

## __Party Secretary__

The Party's Secretary is the Party’s formal liaison with the Electoral Commission of Queensland (ECQ). Flux QLD’s Party Secretary will be the Chairperson of Steering Committee meetings, maintain a Party action register, and play a key role in the overall day to day running of the Party. Applicants for this position on the Steering Committee should ideally have organisational management experience, and are expected to take a senior role amongst the Party’s leadership team. The ECQ defines the role of the Secretary as follows:

  * _Party secretaries are responsible for the party’s administration and external correspondence. An application to include a party in the register must be made by the secretary. An application to change the party’s registered officer must also be made by the secretary. Secretaries may also notify the commission of an agent’s appointment. The commission may ask for documentary evidence of a secretary being appointed in accordance within the party’s constitution._

## __Registered Officer__

The Party’s Registered Officer takes the lead on the nomination process for candidates, as well as their submission to the ECQ. The Registered officer is a key member of the leadership team and will need to be regularly called upon to manage important party matters during the election. Applicants for this role should be highly organised individuals with the ability to manage and prioritise many tasks.The ECQ describes the Registered Officer’s role as follows:

  * _A party’s registered officer is a part of the party’s formal registration details. Changing a registered officer necessitates a formal application, signed by the secretary, to change the register. Registered officers are the commission’s first point of contact for matters related to a party’s registration, other than those concerning disclosure and funding.
  It is the registered officer who:_

    * _nominates the party’s endorsed candidates at State and local government elections;_
    * _makes application to change the party’s registration details other than a change of registered officer;_
    * _gives quarterly reports about the party’s constitution;_
    * _notifies the commission in connection with, and keeps documents relating to, preselection ballots;_
    * _gives the commission documents requested for an audit or investigation of preselection ballots; and can request that the commission cancel the party’s registration._

  _Registered officers cannot resign; they must be replaced on the application of the party secretary_

## __Deputy Registered Officer__

The Deputy Registered Officer supports all of the functions of the Registered Officer and plays a general leadership role, filling the leadership requirements of the party as required.

  * _Registered officers can appoint another person to deputise for them if they are unable to carry out their duties. Appointment of a deputy registered officer is considered prudent albeit one that is optional. A party of which the registered officer is unable to perform his or her function could find itself unable to contest an election or give the commission documents necessary to the party’s continued registration. Nominating a deputy registered officer is an administrative function that does not require the formality of making an application to change the register._

## __Party Agent__

The Party Agent will also serve as the Party’s treasurer and be the first point of contact for all financial matters. Applicants for this position should be numbers orientated, and ideally have some background in financial accounts management.The ECQ defines the Agent’s role as follows:

  * _Registered political parties must appoint an agent whose details are entered into the commission’s Register of Agents. An agent is responsible for giving financial disclosure reports for the party and making election funding claims for the party. Agents are the commission’s first point of contact on all funding and disclosure matters. 
  In the event that an agent’s appointment is no longer in effect the obligations of an agent rest on each member the party’s executive committee._

## __Membership Coordinator__

The Party’s Membership Coordinator holds no formal ECQ role, but plays a vitally important role in the organisation of the party. The Membership Coordinator is responsible for, among other things:

  * Organising Party membership meetups.
  * Regular email communications with members.
  * Serving as a first point of contact for members wanting to get more involved.
  * Enabling members to leverage their skills toward Party goals.

Applicants for this position should be highly personable and charismatic, and during the election campaign be prepared to speak to many members daily.
