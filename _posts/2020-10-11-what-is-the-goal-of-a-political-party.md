In general, Australian political parties are groups registered with the relevant Electoral Commission. These groups are allowed to run candidates under a unified banner in elections managed by that Electoral Commission. Parties aren't necessarily incorporated. Parties are made up of members, at least some of whom must be voters in the relevant elections.

Creating a political party takes time, energy, and resources like money. They aren't cheap to create and are some effort to maintain. It doesn't make sense to start or continue a party if the political party doesn't contribute to some goal.

It's fair to say a party can help achieve multiple goals. When a party is multi-purpose, like this, the goals aren't different from individual goals a party might have. There aren't that many common goals parties help achieve.

The main goals a political party is **uniquely** suited to meet, are:

* Affect the policies enacted by legislatures; either by proposing new legislation, or participating in voting on which legislation to enact.
* Get one particular person, or a group of people, elected.

Both of these involve the interim step of winning elections.

Parties can help meet other goals too, though they're not uniquely suited to these goals. For example, creating a political party can help meet a personal goal of contributing to something meaningful, or the goal of amplifying particular points of view in the media and other discussions. These are *background goals*. Satisfying background goals is not a decisive reasons for doing something.

The purpose of a political party must be **decisive** in meeting particular goals. Those goals are not able to be met in ways other than the creation of a party. The main advantage of a political party in elections, compared to independents, is the privileged treatment with regards to naming and positioning on a ballot paper. It's significantly easier for a candidate of a political party to be elected.

A core goal of a political party, then, must be to affect elections--i.e. increase the chance of a candidate, or multiple candidates, being elected.

A political party which does not *contribute* to *particular candidates* being elected is not very good. Political parties don't need to have their *own* candidates elected to meet the core goal. An easy example can be demonstrated with Flux. We (Flux) have enough members to register multiple parties federally. This would give us certain advantages, though it increases maintenance costs and the overhead of running in elections. If we had, say, 4 federal parties, we could run 4 candidates where previously we could only run 1. In some situations this would increase the chance of us winning a seat. So parties can contribute to the core goal even if the candidate elected is not their own.
