Flux's philosophy whitepaper *Redefining Democracy* has now been published, and we'd like to invite you to read it.

**Abstract:** This paper identifies fundamental flaws in our current democratic systems and explains that while they were useful previously, no longer serve their purpose and need to be replaced. We will explain how authority in democracy acts as a restriction on political progress, and describe a new model of democracy which removes authority from decision making, allowing a new era of political prosperity.
