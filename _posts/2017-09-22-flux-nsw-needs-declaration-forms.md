Desperate times call for desperate measures.

Our election system has shown just how obsolete it is. In order for us to register the Flux NSW party, we need to collect 750 signatures from our members - yes actual signatures signed with a pen BY HAND. Without these signatures, we can't register the NSW party. Simple as that.

Pen? By Hand? Trust us, we are groaning as much as you. WE all know it's 2017, but not everyone does. The rules are the rules until we can change them.

What we need from you to clear this hurdle is:

1. Print out and fill in [this form]({{site.baseurl}}/img/nsw-dec-form.pdf){:target="_blank"} by hand - _(200 seconds)_
2. In the party name section, write **"Flux Party NSW"**
3. Scan it or take a photo from your phone - _(60 seconds)_
4. Send it to [leadership.nsw@voteflux.org](mailto:leadership.nsw@voteflux.org) - _(10 seconds)_

Note, to be eligible you must be registered on the electoral roll in NSW.

If you do not have access to a printer, get in touch with us and we can send you a form in the mail.

If we can get 750 signatures before the end of October then we will be on the ballot for the next state election in 2019 where we will have a real chance at winning a seat! NSW is a strongest state in terms of membership and we came within 200 votes of winning a seat in WA in March.

<div class="center my3"><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/img/nsw-dec-form.pdf" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary h3 letter-spacing-1">I'm ready to sign!</a></div>

We know it's a bit of a hassle - but let's show all those major party politicians that we won't be discouraged - that we can play their game and win it.

As always, thank you for your continuing support.
