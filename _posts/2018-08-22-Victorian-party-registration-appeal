**The Flux Victorian branch is still looking for an avenue to register the party with the Victorian Electoral Commission (VEC) before the State election this coming November.**

Even with over 900 Victorians becoming party members online, Flux was unable to satisfy the Victorian Electoral Commission that it had 500 registered members.

Party Registration Officer Scott Millington has the following to say “The Victorian Branch is currently seeking registration as a political party with the VEC. Though we were unsuccessful in our original application, we are currently going through the appeals process and are hopeful to be registered in time to compete in the November 2018 election”.

If the Electoral Commission was a private company, their registration process would belong in the 20th century. Imagine before you ordered your first Uber you had to print a copy of the terms and conditions, sign with a original signature, mail it to the company and await validation first? 

Flux is about a government with the ability to promote quick change - and we’d like to see the electoral commissions across our country catch up with modern technology. 

Should Flux as a party push for the electoral commissions to reform in regards to how they recognise party membership? We live in a digital world and many believe we  should be able to register members of our party entirely digitally. Digital information with digital signatures would guarantee Flux flourishes across our great nation.
