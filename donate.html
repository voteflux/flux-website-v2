    <h2>Donations</h2>

    <strong>Please note:</strong> If you donate more than $13,000 total in one year we are <strong>required by
    law</strong> to disclose your name and address to the AEC. We will not be able to accept such donations if we don't
    have those details. Please email us if you'd like to make a large donation.

    <p>
      NB: The first $1500 of the donation are tax deductable.
    </p>

    <p>
      All donations need to come with a name and address (unfortunately) due to reporting laws. Basically we need to
      ensure any single person doesn't donate more than $13,000 per year.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please let us know via email if you would like public attribution on our <a
      href="https://flux.wiki/index.php/Finance/Australia">Finances</a> page.

    Flux currently accepts donations via three methods:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Paypal: (See Above)
      </li>
      <li>
        Bank Transfer: our bank details are:<br>
        Name: Max Kaye <br>
        BSB: 06 2948 <br>
        Acct: 1382 4716 <br>
        <strong>Node: You MUST email us after making a bank transfer with your name and address. Otherwise we cannot accept the donation.</strong>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bitcoin: our current donation address is 1EDGSgTW5iGHGesyYACSXYUNbwB6BPEDan<br>
        Please keep in mind the above restrictions around disclosure limits still apply, and you'll still need to email
        us your name and address. Unless we're holding a fundraiser for something specific we'll hold Bitcoin <em>as
        BTC</em> until we need to spend it, and will spend AUD before BTC.
      </li>
    </ul>
