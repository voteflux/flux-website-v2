    <h1>Donations</h1>

    <strong>Please note:</strong> If you donate more than $13,000 total in one year we are <strong>required by
    law</strong> to disclose your name and address to the AEC. We will not be able to accept such donations if we don't
    have those details. Please email us if you'd like to make a large donation.

    <p>
      NB: The first $1500 of the donation are tax deductable.
    </p>

    <p>
      All donations need to come with a name and address (unfortunately) due to reporting laws. Basically we need to
      ensure any single person doesn't donate more than $13,000 per year.
    </p>

        us your name and address. Unless we're holding a fundraiser for something specific we'll hold Bitcoin/Ether <em>as
        BTC or ETH</em> until we need to spend it, and will spend AUD before crypto.
