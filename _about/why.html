  body: 'Australians will no longer be limited to labour vs liberal. Through innovative 
    technology, Flux will divert political power and efficiency away from the gridlocked 
    system and back to the people and the experts.

- subheading: Our politics is MIA. It’s DOA. Even worse, it’s DOS.
  body: 'Our politicians say one thing to get elected and then do another. Horse trading
    and back room deals have become more important than good policy, and the will
    of the people. Powerful lobby groups, and international corporations wield enormous
    political power, while ordinary Australians have little meaningful say in their
    country.

'
- subheading: You wouldn’t use the same operating system for 400 years would you?
  body: 'Democracy is no different. Parliament is a 19th century power structure that
    no longer works in the modern age. The system needs to process more information
    every day than one could read in a lifetime. The demands for governmental specialisation
    and decentralisation have never been higher. Yet the gridlocks of lobbyists, party
    politics and hesitation block up the system.  That’s why it’s time for an upgrade.

<p class="">Australian politics is broken. Traditional politicians say one thing to get elected and then do another. Horse trading and back room deals have become more important than good policy, and the will of the people. Powerful lobby groups, and international corporations wield enormous political power, while ordinary Australians have little meaningful say in their country.</p>
<p>Our parliament is based on the exclusivity of a nineteenth century power structure that doesn't work for the information age. When it comes to the challenges of a modern world, it's just not up to the task. As more information is produced every day than one could read in a lifetime, the demands for governmental specialisation and decentralisation have never been higher. Using some clever technology, Flux will put political power into the hands of those best suited to use it.</p>
<p>New policy platforms are not enough to fix this mess. “Business as usual” just won't do. Flux is here to redistribute political power, empower the Australian people through real political participation, and enable specialists to help repair bad policy. Flux will give Australia the framework it needs to meet the challenges of the 21st century head on.</p>

<p>We believe in democracy.</p>
<p>Our mission is the distribution of real political power to include all Australians.</p>
<p>We are a movement of political expression, not political ideology. We value the contribution of every Australian, no matter how great or small. We believe in a system which promotes autonomy, purpose, and expertise, as means to deliver excellent policy.</p>
<p>We seek to dismantle political apathy, by empowering the disenfranchised, and motivating a new generation of innovative Australians to take responsibility for their society.</p>
<p>We value people, not some people, but all people, and recognise our differences as strengths, not weaknesses.</p>
<p>We believe in a free and open society, characterised by freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the free flow of political ideas.</p>
<p>We are excited about a democracy for the information age. One which fosters constructive criticism, encourages innovation, and empowers our best and brightest.</p>
