    <p>We are planning to run in every State and Federal election from here on out, as well as some local elections. To do this we need solid leadership teams in each state and strong communities in all major cities. So take intiative and start a meetup group in your local commuinty. We can help cover the costs and even advertise your group from our main Facebook Page.</p>

        Check if a Flux group already exists in your country. We currently have groups starting in Australia, The U.K., The U.S. and Brazil.
      </li>
      <li>
        If not then the first thing you want to do is try and build up a new Flux community in your country. You would be surprised how quickly people are willing to jump on board and help out once a community has been started.
      </li>
      <li>
        To do this we would recommend creating a Facebook Group, or you can use any other community tools that might be popular in your country.

    <p>Get involved and make change in Australian politics. We value the contribution of every Australian, no matter how great or small. Find out how you can help Flux by sharing, participating and voting democratically in the next Australian federal election.</p>
    <p>Our number one goal right now is get someone elected to a position of power who is commited to using the Flux System of Issue Based Direct Democracy. The fastest way to do that in most representative democracies is to get enough votes in an election to win a seat in parliament. Anything you can do to help us reach this goal will be most appreciated.</p>
