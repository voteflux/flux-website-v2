faqs:
- question: Is membership free?
  answer: 'Yes. Membership is free forever. We don''t believe charging a membership
    fee is necessary, and are working on other methods of funding to ensure we can
    provide open access to democracy to as many people as possible.

'
- question: Does Flux have a platform?
  answer: 'Yes and no. We do have a platform of parliamentary reform, and we deliberately
    do not have any other platforms. We only seek to change the way decisions are
    made, not to actually make the decisions ourselves. The vision of Flux is not
    to be the source of new policy. The vision is to help the best policy be written.

'
- question: Are membership details confidential?
  answer: 'Yes. Membership details will be exclusively used for party business, and
    never sold or willfully disclosed. Access to <em>relevant</em> private details of members is granted to the 
    respective registered officers of the Federal and state branches for the purposes of registration
    only. Access to contact details, first names, suburbs, and postcodes is granted to 
    members of Steering Committees responsible for communication with members. Addtionally
    Max has access to the full membership database as he administers it. Registered officers
    can be found on the respective party lists maintained by all electoral commissions.

'
- question: Why do I need Flux; I already have a representative?
  answer: 'While some representatives are good, none are good enough to represent
    everyone in their electorate. Too often people''s concerns are ignored because
    their representative has different views to them. Flux believes nobody should
    be cut off from democracy just because they disagree with their representative.

'
- question: Can I still sign up if I'm a member of another political party?
  answer: |
    Yes! The AEC is specific in their criterion for registration: "at least 500 members who are on the Commonwealth electoral roll and who are not also relied upon by another party for registration purposes."

    This means you're able to support Flux as a founding member if you're a member of any other party with a parliamentarian (so Labor, Liberal, Nationals, Greens, etc are all okay). The only time it is an issue is if you are a member of a party who does not have a parliamentarian, and are used by that party to support their registration.
- question: Where do you provide attribution for creative common licensed works?
  answer: 'Here: <a href="https://voteflux.org/attribution">voteflux.org/attribution</a>

'
- question: Is your voting system the same as direct democracy?
  answer: |
    No. Although there are similarities, they are philosophically very different.
    The main practical differences are:
    <ul>
        <li>Swapping votes is allowed</li>
        <li>Saving 'political capital' over time is allowed</li>
        <li>Some similarities are: conservation of votes and distributing uniformly over the population. <small>'Conservation of votes' is said in the same way we'd talk about 'conservation of energy' => they cannot be created or destroyed, so the number of votes before trading is always equal to the number of votes after trading, regardless of what went on in the middle.</small></li>
    </ul>
- question: How are candidates selected?
  answer: 'Please see: <a href="https://github.com/voteflux/voteflux.github.io/blob/master/posts/candidate-selection.md">https://github.com/voteflux/voteflux.github.io/blob/master/posts/candidate-selection.md</a>

'
- question: Where is the Flux constitution?
  answer: 'Here: <a href="https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md">https://github.com/voteflux/flux/blob/master/CONSTITUTION.md</a>

'
- question: When was party registration finalized?
  answer: 'March 29th 2016; an extremely quick application time of 2 months and 2
    days.

'
- question: How can I revoke my membership?
  answer: 'There is a button on your user details page in red at the bottom. All you
    need to do is click that. You were emailed a link to your user details when you
    joined, from the Flux Membership Robot. You can have another link sent to you <a href="https://api.voteflux.org/static/html/member_resend_deets.html">here</a> if you require it.
    <br><br>
    As per the constitution, you cannot revoke your membership via email.

'
- question: Where is my member details page?
  answer: 'Your member details link is sent to you when you first sign up. If you
    need it to be sent again, you can do so <a href="https://api.voteflux.org/static/html/member_resend_deets.html">here</a>.

'
- question: How do I become a volunteer?
  answer: 'Please either tick the box on your member details page, or put your email
    in to <a href="https://api.voteflux.org/static/html/member_volunteer.html">this
    page</a>, you''ll then be sent further instructions :). Most of the volunteer
    coordination happens via our <a href="https://community.voteflux.org">community
    forums</a>.

'
- question: How do you prevent people voting more than once on the Flux app?
  answer: 'We validate every participant against the electoral role before we start
    giving them votes. Additionally, all votes are public so if someone were to try
    and vote twice it would be immediately obvious and can just be ignored by auditors.
    Since auditing software will be publicly available, anyone can audit and verify
    the result of any issue that goes through the Flux system.
