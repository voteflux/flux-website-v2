    body: >
      <p>Our mission is the distribution of real political power to include all Australians. <p>
      <p>We are a movement of political expression, not political ideology. We value the contribution of every Australian, no matter how great or small. We believe in a system which promotes autonomy, purpose, and expertise, as means to deliver excellent policy.</p>
      <p>We seek to dismantle political apathy, by empowering the disenfranchised, and motivating a new generation of innovative Australians to take responsibility for their society.</p>

  - subheading: We value people, not some people, but all people, and recognise our differences as strengths, not weaknesses.
    body: >
      <p>We believe in a free and open society, characterised by freedom of speech, freedom of association, and the free flow of political ideas.</p>
      <p>We are excited about a democracy for the information age. One which fosters constructive criticism, encourages innovation, and empowers our best and brightest.</p>
